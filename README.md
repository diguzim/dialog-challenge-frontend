# Dialog Challenge - Frontend

Hello, this is the frontend part of the challenge for a job interview, a very interesting one btw.

Pretty much this frontend has to be a React PWA that uses hooks, React Router, Apollo Client, styled-components, css grid, and a service worker, i.e., the app should keep working offline (for the pages that had already been visited)

The portal has 3 pages:

1. The Home page, that shows all the user in clickable cards
2. The User details page, that shows the informations of a user and it's friends cards
3. The search results page (there is a search text input in the upper part)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), with --template typescript.

## How to run this

It's pretty simple:

1. Clone this repo and navigate to it's folder
2. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start` to run it locally on port 3000
